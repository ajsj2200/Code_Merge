Please carefully review the following code snippet:

<code>
{{ CODE_SNIPPET }}
</code>

Analyze the code line-by-line and identify any areas where it deviates from the coding conventions and best practices outlined in the guide. For each deviation you find, please list it out along with a brief explanation of what the issue is. 

After listing any deviations, please provide an overall adherence score from 1-5, where 1 means the code completely fails to follow the guidelines and 5 means it follows the guidelines perfectly. Provide a brief justification for the score you gave.

Write your list of deviations (if any) inside <deviations> tags, your adherence score inside <score> tags, and the justification inside <score_justification> tags.

If you find no deviations from the coding guide, simply write "No deviations found." inside the <deviations> tags.
